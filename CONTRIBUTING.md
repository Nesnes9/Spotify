## Before starting

This project uses Git, the most used version management tool in the world.
For more information, click <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/2342361-gerez-votre-code-avec-git-et-github"> here </a>

1. Good already, please [forker the repository] (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Retrieve the code from your fork.

3. Test it with an Apache server (MAMP type, see Docker) or other server solution.

4. Contribute!

You are ready to contribute!


## Recommended work tools

1 single rule, WINDOWS IS NO! If you don't have a Mac, Linux will do just fine.

### Development environment

The best development environment for this project (by far) in our eyes is Visual Studio Code.
If you don't have it, don't worry PHPStorm will do just fine.


## I want to improve the documentation for developers

There is none at the moment (except the .md that you will find on this repo), but if you want to offer one, we are interested.


## I want to offer a new feature

Do you have an idea of functionality that has not yet been proposed for the Spotify Project? Do not hesitate to offer it to us!
To do this, create a new issue by describing your idea.


For example: as a user interested in Spotify, I would like to be able to exchange music directly from the site.

Do not hesitate to add screenshots of what you have thought of or describe the expected behaviors
in details. If necessary, we will ask you questions in the issue in order to detail all the possible cases.

## I have finished my functionality, I would like to offer them

Now that you've finished your work, you just need to "pusher" it on your "fork" and create a
pull request on the develop repository.

To improve your pull request and give it a better chance of being accepted, we recommend the following things:
following:

- Follow good PHP practices (https://phptherightway.com)
- Read the .md files carefully

Once your code is accepted, you should end up doing this:

- you will have to rebase your pull request on `master` to avoid conflicts
- you will have to squash your commits in a single commit to improve the readability of our Git history
